The five stages of hacking
MAKE SURE YOU STAY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT THEY ASK !!!
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE
01. Reconnaissance 
_______________________
- Passive vs Active 


Location Information:
- Satellite Images
TODO- Check if theirs location information on their website
TODO- Google Maps, find anything of interest
- Drone recon
- Building Layout (badge readers, break areas, security, fencing)


Job Information:
- Employees (name, job title, phone number, manager, etc)
TODO- Check if their employees are on their page, then search their social medias
TODO- Gather company email addresses using hunter.io
TODO- Gather information from their website (contact section) for emails
- Pictures (badge photos, desk photos, computer photos, etc)


Target Vaildation:
- Make sure they are infact the owners of the subnet or domain they give you
- Tools: WHOIS, NSLOOKUP, DNSRECON


Finding Subdomains:
- Finding out the subdomains of the domain
- Tools: Google Fu, dig, Nmap, Sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh, etc.



Fingerprinting:
- Finding out what software they are using 
- Tools: Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat
Google dorking
TODO - site:tesla.com -www
TODO - site:tesla.com filetype:pdf
TODO - thehavester
TODO - bluto
TODO - https://crt.sh/ information about certificates
TODO - install wappalyzer - Able to see services that their running
TODO - search up if any of these services are vulnerable
TODO - builtwith.com 

COMMANDS:
########
theharvester -d tesla.com -l 500 -b google
(finds some subdomains, emails, and interesting emails)
pip install bluto
(bluto does dnslookup, zone transfer, allows for more infromation gathering)

(errors can be fixed using editing data_mine.py)
(import olefile)

Data Breaches:

Tools: HaveIbeenPwned and similar lists, BreachList

TODO- BreachParse

COMMANDS - BreachParse:
#########
git clone https://github.com/cronos-hash/breach-parse
breach-parse @tesla.com tesla.txt
#########

TODO- Check databreaches and HaveIbeenPwned + hunter.io emails
########

02. Scanning and Enumeration
____________________________
- Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, etc
SCAN both TCP side and UDP side

COMMANDS
########
whatweb -v tesla.com
wireshark &
go to the domain
then analysis the traffic interactions with the domain
We need to confirm that theres a [SYN], [SYN, ACK],[ACK]  means that the port is open
if it shows it means we can confirm that connection

nmap --help
nmap -sU     	(UDP scan)

Ping sweep:
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

-T4 - 1 speed (not a stealthy scan)
nmap -T4 192.168.1.254
MAKE SURE TO SCAN EVERY PORT

Staging:
nmap -T4 -p- 192.168.1.254

Which ports are open ?

add them to this scan vv
vv
Now scan these ports using:
Nmap -T4 -A p53,80,111,443,514 192.168.1.254

(Go to scan) Not recommened , worst case scenario
nmap -T4 -A -p- 192.168.1.254
we can develop this futher:


Saves results:
nmap -T4 -p- 192.168.1.254 -oA client
Can write a script that adds all these ports to this scan:
nmap -T4 -A p<saved client files> 192.168.1.54

UDP SCANS ------
nmap -sU -T4 192.168.1.254
cant trust a UDP scan (time consuming , let nexxus find it)



NMAP SCRIPTS -------
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
vulnerability scanning:

nmap -p 443 --script=all 

gives a rating on all the ciphers:
nmap -p 443 --script=ssl-enum-ciphers tesla.com
and then the least strength of a cipher

Vulnerabiliy Scanning:
Download and install nessus:
dpkg -i Nessus.deb
make account
click new scan
click basic scan
type in targets seperated by comma at newscan/basic scan
in the discovery section you can select all ports rather then specify specific ones
scan type: default , unless its web scan 
go to My scan > then select Launch

nikto -h https://tesla.com

msfconsole
search portscan
use auxiliary/portscan/syn
set ports 1-65535
set rhosts 192.168.1.254
run
will tell you if a ports open or closed , pretty much it 

but what are you looking for ?

search tomcat
